A PHP class to reference countries and territories of the world and their regions and subregions as defined by ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2. Adapted from the work of the <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-isocodes/">Debian ISO Codes table and translation project</a>.

Includes ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes mapped to short and long territory name. Pass an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code to the regions function to retrieve regions, subregions, and appropriate labels for each (state, province, parish, etc.).
